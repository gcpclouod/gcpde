###  in a streaming data pipeline with Apache Beam, windowing can be configured to produce results periodically based on the defined window duration. Here's a detailed breakdown of how windowing works in this context:
```python

Windowing in Streaming Data
Windowing Concept:

Fixed Windows: In a streaming pipeline, applying a fixed window (e.g., 60 seconds) means that the data is grouped into 60-second intervals. Each interval is a separate window.
Triggering Results: The results for each window can be output periodically. For instance, if you use a 60-second fixed window, Beam can emit results for each window every 60 seconds, depending on the processing and trigger settings.
Output Frequency:

Periodic Output: If you want to print results to the console every 60 seconds, you need to ensure that your Beam pipeline is configured to trigger outputs at the end of each window. Beam handles this internally based on the window and trigger configuration.
Example of Printing Every 60 Seconds: In the context of the example script provided earlier, the output will be produced at the end of each 60-second window. This means that:

Data Collection: Messages are collected and grouped into 60-second windows.
Processing and Output: Once the window closes (i.e., after 60 seconds), Beam processes the data in that window and prints the results to the console.
Practical Considerations
Triggering: In a more advanced setup, you can configure custom triggers to control when results are emitted. By default, Beam will emit results at the end of each window, but triggers can be set for more complex use cases.
Latency: There may be a small delay in seeing results, depending on the processing time and the specific Beam runner (e.g., Dataflow, Flink). However, the window duration defines the intervals at which results are expected.
