### Explanation:
```python
Combiner Function (sum_quantities):

The sum_quantities function takes a list of values (quantities in this case) and returns their sum. This function will be applied to the values associated with each key.
Creating a PCollection:

The beam.Create transform is used to create a PCollection of key-value pairs where the key is a category (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books) and the value is the quantity sold.
Applying the beam.CombinePerKey Transform:

The beam.CombinePerKey transform applies the sum_quantities function to the values associated with each key in the PCollection. This computes the total quantity sold for each category.
Printing the Results:

The final PCollection contains the total quantities for each category, which are printed to the console.

Explanation:

Sum: Aggregates by summing values for each key.
Count: Counts the number of values associated with each key.
Average: Calculates the average value for each key.
Minimum: Finds the smallest value for each key.
Maximum: Finds the largest value for each key.
