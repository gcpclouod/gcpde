Explanation of yield
Using yield:

When you use yield in a function, it converts the function into a generator. Unlike functions that return a single value or a list of values all at once, a generator created with yield produces values one at a time. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to process data sequentially or deal with large datasets.

For example, in a function designed to filter words based on their length, using yield allows the function to yield each word that meets the condition (e.g., len(word) >= 4). If a word does not meet the condition, the function simply does not yield anything, effectively filtering out that word.

 
### Copy code
```python
def filter_short_words(word):
    if len(word) >= 4:
        yield word
Why Use yield?

Efficiency:

Generators created by yield are more memory-efficient because they generate items on the fly, rather than constructing and returning a full list at once. This reduces the memory overhead, especially when dealing with large collections of data.
Lazy Evaluation:

Generators yield items as needed, meaning they only produce values when iterated over. This lazy evaluation is particularly beneficial in large-scale data processing tasks where loading all data into memory at once is impractical or impossible.
Using yield can significantly optimize your data processing workflows by providing a streamlined, memory-efficient way to handle and transform data, one piece at a time.
