Explanation:
Pipeline Options:

The PipelineOptions object is used to specify options for the pipeline, such as the runner type (e.g., DirectRunner for local execution or DataflowRunner for Google Cloud Dataflow) and other configuration parameters.
If you're running the pipeline on Google Cloud Dataflow, you need to specify the project and temp_location parameters, among others.

Pipeline Creation:

The beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) creates a new pipeline instance with the specified options.
The with statement ensures that the pipeline's resources are properly managed and that the pipeline is executed when the block is exited.

Reading Input Data:

The pipeline reads data from a text file located in Google Cloud Storage using beam.io.ReadFromText. Replace the gs://your-gcs-bucket/input.txt with the actual path to your file.

Transformations:

beam.FlatMap is used to split each line of text into individual words.
beam.Map pairs each word with the number 1.
beam.CombinePerKey(sum) sums up the counts for each word to get the total occurrences.

Writing Output Data:

The results are written to an output text file using beam.io.WriteToText. Replace the gs://your-gcs-bucket/output.txt with the path where you want to save the output.
Running the Pipeline:

The pipeline is executed by calling p.run().
